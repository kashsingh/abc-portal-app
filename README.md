# ABC Portal App Client

## About
This is just a simple demo Angular application for implementing a college portal for the students using **Angular 5** with **[Clarity Design System](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/)** using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for application security. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. This project uses [abc-portal-service](https://github.com/kashsingh/abc-college-service) for backend. Please clone the project too before using this.

Use these credentials to explore the application:

```
Admin - admin:admin
Student User - vegeta:password
Student User - maxpayne:password 
Student User - goku:password
```

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

#### Note: You can try the backend client created using Spring Boot and Spring Security for the application [here](https://github.com/kashsingh/abc-portal-app).
